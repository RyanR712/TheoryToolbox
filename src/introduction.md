**"Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart."** - Fyodor Dostoyevsky

Therefore, via affirming the consequent, we can conclude that, by feeling pain and suffering, 
I can achieve a large intelligence and a deep heart.

This is a catalogue of all the axioms, definitions, theorems, lemmas and corollaries I come across in the hope that one day, 
I might use one of them.

I would also like this to serve as some sort of character statement, here, on more of a serious note.
I'm noticing this pattern for desire for creativity in myself and workplaces, since it seems there's
undue cynicism out there preventing people from thinking very hard about what it even means to try.
And that is a real thing. That happens. When I say I need time to think, I... spend several hours doing so.

Please believe me when I say I never thought I'd be the kind of person to say this stuff.
However, it's not that I don't want to, but in fact that I cannot produce motivation without taking myself and the things I
know way too seriously, at the very least in my head.
Note that I do not think I know everything. I don't know everything. But that just means I know where to head next.

I will decompose your dreams, I will connect the dots you didn't know were there at first and I will recompose your dreams
into something computers can do. That is not some grandiose promise and instead just... what a software developer does.
