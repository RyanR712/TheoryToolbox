# Chapter 1.2: Tautologies

Truth function of *n* arguments: Function with *n* parameters, which each have truth values **T** and **F**. Page 6

Tautology: Statement form that is true regardless of the truth values of its statement letters. Page 6

"A statement form is a tautology if and only if its corresponding truth function takes only the value T,
or equivalently, if, in its truth table, the column under the statement form
contains only Ts." Page 6
