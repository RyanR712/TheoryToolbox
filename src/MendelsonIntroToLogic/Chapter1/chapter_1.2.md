# Chapter 1.2: Tautologies

Truth function of *n* arguments: Function with *n* parameters, which each have truth values **T** and **F**. Page 6

Tautology: Statement form that is true regardless of the truth values of its statement letters. Page 6

"A statement form is a tautology if and only if its corresponding truth function takes only the value T,
or equivalently, if, in its truth table, the column under the statement form
contains only Ts." Page 6

Law of the excluded middle: (A ∨ ¬A). Page 6

Logical imply (verb): If and only if every truth value of the statement letters of *B* and *C* that makes *B* true also
makes *C* true. *B* logically implies *C* and *C* is a logical consequence of *B*. Page 6

Example: *A* ∧ *B* logically implies *A*, and *A* ∨ *B* is a logical consequences of *A*. Page 6

Proposition 1.1

a. *B* logically implies *C* if and only if *B* ⇒ *C* is a tautology.

b. *B* and *C* are logically equivalent if and only if *B* ⇔ *C* is a tautology.
