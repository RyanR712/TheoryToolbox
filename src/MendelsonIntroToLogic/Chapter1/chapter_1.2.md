# Chapter 1.2: Tautologies

Truth function of \\( n \\) arguments: Function with \\( n \\) parameters, 
which each have truth values \\( T \\) and \\( F \\). Page 6

Tautology: Statement form that is true for all truth values of its statement letters. Page 6

"A statement form is a tautology if and only if its corresponding truth function takes only the value \\( T \\),
or equivalently, if, in its truth table, the column under the statement form
contains only \\( T \\)s." Page 6

Law of the excluded middle: \\( A \lor \neg A \\). Page 6

Logically imply (verb): If and only if every truth value of the statement letters of \\( B \\) 
and \\( C \\) that makes \\( B \\) true also
makes \\( C \\) true. \\( B \\) logically implies \\( C \\) and \\( C \\) is a logical consequence of \\( B \\). Page 6

Example: \\( A \land B \\) logically implies \\( A \\), and \\( A \lor B \\) is a logical consequences of \\( A \\). Page 6

# Proposition 1.1: Page 7

a. \\( B \\) logically implies \\( C \\) if and only if \\( B \Rightarrow C \\) is a tautology.

b. \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) are logically equivalent if and only if \\( B \Leftrightarrow C \\) is a tautology.

Contradictory (adj.): Statement form that is false for all truth values of its statement letters. Has only \\( F \\)s in the
final column of its truth table. Page 9

"...a statement form \\( B \\) is a tautology if and only if \\( \neg B \\) is contradictory, and vice versa." Page 9

Logically true (adj.): Describes a sentence that comes from substituting each statement letter in a tautology with 
sentences. Page 9

Logically false (adj.) Describes a sentence that comes from substituting each statement letter in a contradiction with 
sentences. Page 10

# Proposition 1.2: Page 10

If \\( B \\) is a tautology and \\( B \Rightarrow C \\) is a tautology, then \\( C \\) is a tautology.

# Proposition 1.3: Page 10

If \\( B \\) is logically true, as in it is a result of substituting sentences for statement letters 
in a tautology, then it is a tautology.

# Proposition 1.4: Page 10

"If \\( C_1 \\) arises from \\( B_1 \\) by substitution of \\( C \\) for one or more occurrences of \\( B \\), then
\\( B \Leftrightarrow C \Rightarrow (B_1 \Leftrightarrow C_1) \\) is a tautology. 
Hence, if \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) are logically equivalent,
then so are \\( B_1 \\) and \\( C_1 \\)."
