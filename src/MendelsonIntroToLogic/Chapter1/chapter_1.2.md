# Chapter 1.2: Tautologies

Truth function of *n* arguments: Function with *n* parameters, which each have truth values **T** and **F**. Page 6

Tautology: Statement form that is true for all truth values of its statement letters. Page 6

"A statement form is a tautology if and only if its corresponding truth function takes only the value **T**,
or equivalently, if, in its truth table, the column under the statement form
contains only **T**s." Page 6

Law of the excluded middle: (A ∨ ¬A). Page 6

Logically imply (verb): If and only if every truth value of the statement letters of *B* and *C* that makes *B* true also
makes *C* true. *B* logically implies *C* and *C* is a logical consequence of *B*. Page 6

Example: *A* ∧ *B* logically implies *A*, and *A* ∨ *B* is a logical consequences of *A*. Page 6

Proposition 1.1: Page 7

a. *B* logically implies *C* if and only if *B* ⇒ *C* is a tautology.

b. *B* and *C* are logically equivalent if and only if *B* ⇔ *C* is a tautology.

Contradictory (adj.): Statement form that is false for all truth values of its statement letters. Has only **F**s in the
final column of its truth table. Page 9

"...a statement form **B** is a tautology if and only if (¬**B**) is contradictory, and vice versa." Page 9

Logically true (adj.): Describes a sentence that comes from substituting each statement letter in a tautology with 
sentences. Page 9

Logically false (adj.) Describes a sentence that comes from substituting each statement letter in a contradiction with 
sentences. Page 10

Proposition 1.2: Page 10

If **B** is a tautology and (**B**⇒**C**) is a tautology, then **C** is a tautology.

Proposition 1.3: Page 10

If **B** is logically true, as in it is a result of substituting sentences for statement letters 
in a tautology, then it is a tautology.

Proposition 1.4: Page 10

"If **C**1 arises from **B**1 by substitution of **C** for one or more occurrences of **B**, then
((**B** ⇔ **C**) ⇒ (**B**1 ⇔ **C**1)) is a tautology. Hence, if **B** and **C** are logically equivalent,
then so are **B**1 and **C**1."
