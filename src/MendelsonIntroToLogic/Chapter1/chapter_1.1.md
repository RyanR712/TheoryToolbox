# Chapter 1.1: Propositional Connectives: Truth Tables

Truth-functional (adj.): "Combinations in which the truth or falsity of the new sentence is determined by 
the truth or falsity of its component sentences." - Page 1

Negation: Operation represented by \\( \neg \\).
Changes a \\( True \\) to \\( False \\) and a \\( False \\) to \\( True \\). Page 1

Truth table: A table showing, for each combination of \\( True \\) or \\( False \\) given to the sentences, gives the output
of the operation performed on them. Page 1

Negation truth table:

Truth values: \\( True \\) or \\( False \\) in reference to the evaluation of an operation or the value given to a sentence. 
Note: From here on, \\( T = True \\) and \\( F = False \\). Page 1

Conjunction: Operation represented by \\( \land \\). Page 1

Conjunction truth table:

Conjuncts: Two or more sentences linked together by \\( \land \\). Page 1

Disjunction: Operation represented by \\( \lor \\). Page 2

Disjunction truth table:

Disjuncts: Two or more sentences linked together by \\( \lor \\). Page 2

Conditional: Operation represented by \\( \Rightarrow \\). May be read as "If A, then B," for sentences A and B. Page 2

Antecedent: Sentence on the left side of \\( \Rightarrow \\).

Consequent: Sentence on the right side of \\( \Rightarrow \\).

Conditional truth table:

Biconditional: Operation represented by \\( \Leftrightarrow \\). 
May be read as "A if and only if B," for sentences A and B. Page 3

Biconditional truth table:

Propositional connectives: \\( \neg \\), \\( \land \\), \\( \lor \\), \\( \Rightarrow \\), \\( \Leftrightarrow \\). 
"Any sentence built up by application of these connectives has a truth value that
depends on the truth values of the constituent sentences." Page 3

Statement letters: Letters that represent sentences and may take \\( T \\) or \\( F \\) as truth values. Page 3

Statement form: Expression built from statement letters and valid applications of propositional connectives. Page 3-4
    
1. All statement letters (capital italic letters) and statement letters with numerical subscripts are statement forms.

2. If \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) are statement forms, so are 
\\( \neg B, \ B \land C, \ B \lor C, \ B \Rightarrow C \\) and \\( B \Leftrightarrow C \\).

3. Only the expressions determined by the above 1. and 2. are statement forms.

Truth function: "For every assignment of truth values T or F to the statement letters that occur
in a statement form, there corresponds, by virtue of the truth tables for the
propositional connectives, a truth value for the statement form." May be represented accurately as a truth table. Page 4

For \\ ( n \\) distinct letters in a statement form, there are \\( 2^n \\) possible assignments 
of truth values and \\( 2^n \\) rows in the
truth table. Page 4

Principal connective: Propositional connective "applied last in constructing the form." Page 5

Atomic sentences: Sentences not composed of other sentences. Page 5
