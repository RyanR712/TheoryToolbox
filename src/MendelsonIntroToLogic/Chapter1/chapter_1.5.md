# Chapter 1.5: Independence: Many-Valued Logics

Independent axioms: A subset of the axioms in formal theory *Y* that cannot be proved from by rules of inference from the

# Proposition 1.17: Page 37

Each axiom schema laid out in chapter 1.4 is independent.

The proof is worth reading at length. Continuing to 1.6 for now
