# First-Order Logic and Model Theory

My vague understanding, going in, is that First-Order logics deal with qualifiers on statement letters and maybe I have seen
one or two mentions of functions on specific statement letters in passing. That is all I'm confident saying.

Model theories I believe go into constructing logics in the first place, and are more of a philosophy topic since they
concern how to determine what is true and what is false.

I am more interested in the model theory, but I also recognize that first-order logics are a decently sized chunk of logic
studies and I am excited to learn the basics.

This chapter, after creating all the subchapter files, looks like it will be not long, but definitely hard to parse. Still
inspired, somehow.
